## 🎯 Project Milestones

### Milestone 1: Basic Solar System Foundation
**Goal:** Create a working 3D scene with the Sun and planets in basic orbits

**Features to Implement:**
- Set up Three.js scene, camera, and renderer
- Create the Sun as a glowing sphere in the center
- Add 8 planets as colored spheres with correct relative sizes
- Implement basic circular orbital motion
- Add simple controls (mouse orbit, zoom)

**Success Criteria:**
- All planets visible and rotating around the Sun
- Smooth 60fps animation
- Basic camera controls working
- Proper scaling and positioning

**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours

### Milestone 2: Realistic Visuals & Physics
**Goal:** Transform the basic system into a visually stunning and scientifically accurate representation

**Features to Implement:**
- Add realistic planet textures (Earth, Mars, Jupiter, etc.)
- Implement proper lighting with the Sun as light source
- Add planet rotation on their own axes
- Create elliptical orbits with correct speeds
- Add asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter
- Include planet moons (Earth's Moon, Jupiter's major moons)
- Add a starfield background

**Success Criteria:**
- Photorealistic planet appearances
- Accurate orbital periods and distances (scaled)
- Proper day/night cycles on planets
- Smooth animations with realistic physics

**Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours
